## Comparisons
| (Features) | FastRead | [Readsy][3] | [Spreedr][2] |
|--------|---------|---|---|
| WPM Control | 200 - 800 | 200 - 400 | Unlimited  |
| Momentum Control | Toggle | Yes | None |
| Offline | Yes | Yes | No |
| By-character Support | Yes | No | No |
| Word Highlighting | Yes | No | No |
| ORP | Yes | Yes | No |
| URL Import | No(t yet) | Yes | From App |
| Commercialised | No | Yes | Yes |

It seems like at the moment, Readsy (that is using Spritz API) has the higher similarity with FastRead and a wider range of feature although lacking of by-character support.
This does not support languages like Mandarin in their reading application unlike FastRead.
Plus, FastRead will remain uncommercialised and open source.

## How to use
When loading the page, you will be presented with a large text area, a group of inputs below it, and a blank box on the right of your widescreen or at the bottom of your mobile screen.

#### 1. Text Area
![Text area](demo/textarea.png "Text area for fast reading")

Put your long text inside here. It can be any languages even those that use a single character as a word, which can be toggled in the configuration below the text area.

#### 2. Delay
![Delay Configuration](demo/delay.png "Delay before start reading")

This input is for the delay before starting the reading. This can be useful for mobile users that requires scrolling before they are able to focus on the screen.

#### 3. WPM (Words Per Minute)
![WPM Configuration](demo/wpm-range.png "Words to show per minute")

![WPM Display](demo/wpm-display.png "Displays words to show per minute")

This configures the number of words to show in a minute.

#### 4. Show By Character
![By Character Checkbox](demo/bychar.png "To read character by character")

This checkbox enable character-by-character reading instead of word-by-word. This can be useful to languages that can represent a word using a single character (like Mandarin).

<small> Note: The small character in Japanese (like the small „Å£) is treated as a single character. </small>

#### 5. Control Momentum
![Control Reading Momentum](demo/controlmomentum.png "To pause by clause")

This is to give a momentary pause to clause markers such as a comma, a full-stop, etc. This can be useful to give some time to digest rapid information that is coming through the screen.

##### 6. Buttons
![Functional Buttons](demo/play-button.png "To start rolling the texts")

Click this button to start rolling the text. When rolling the texts, the shown text on the screen is also highlighted in the text area.

![Functional Buttons](demo/pause-stop-button.png "To pauses and stop rolling the texts")

Click this button to pause or stop the rolling of the text.
