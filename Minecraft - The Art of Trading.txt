- Introduction
We live in a mysterious world, but we have adapted to do various stuffs to keep us alive. Trading is a tradition to keep us from having not enough resources or the capacity to satisfy one own needs and wants. Briefly, it is a fairly easy process. First, two parties, that is either an individual, a company, or simply an entity that can perform a valid trading, must exist where each of them has one or more items of interest of the opposite party. The process finalises after the exchanging of these items indicating that there exists a mutual agreement for this trade. Sometimes, a supporting party or platform can act as a witness to prevent cheats in between these two parties, which can be helpful to provide a sense of security in the trading process for both sides. This action introduces an economy system for limited resources in this world.

- Why do we trade?
We benefit from the trading system as an alternative way to obtain items without having to do the "hard" way. For example, an apple has 1 in 200 chance of being dropped from an oak or a dark oak leaf, so on average, you would need to break 200 of such leaves to get one apple. Even though this is a pretty time-consuming process, some may do this as a job-basis to farm a mass amount of items so that in the future, they can exchange these with another items of their interest with another people. Clear evidences of trading can always be seen during the time of being alive in this world as people would broadcast their offer and their needs into the global messaging system. This messaging system alone is another story to tell because no one really knows how did we evolve to adapt such ability, but the existensive usage of this system to notify their trading offer globally is a strong proof of the need of a trading system in this world.

- Vanilla Trading
How could we forget the existence of villagers that we can mysteriously interact with their pre-defined trading? We have known villagers as passive entities possessing an infinite number of item that only the higher beings know how on earth does that work. Every villager shares the same emerald-based currency system and has a set of trade that matches their profession. A workstation, for example a composter, assigns a villager to a profession (in this case either a farmer or a lumberjack profession). Since they frequently restock in the day time, they are the source of infinite resources as long as they have access to their workstation. Another variant of a villager is a wandering trader. They work the same as villagers except for the workstation part, and they also bring two llamas with them. Collectively, they are a great alternative to get items that can be difficult to obtain elsewhere.

- Currency-based vs Bartering Trades
Trading is not limited to villagers only. People like us can also perform trading in the same way as villagers do, and we would use different materials as the currency rather than villagers that trade on emeralds. Diamond is an attractive choice of currency because it can be crafted into useful items such as tools and armours, but the catch is: they are limited and harder to obtain. They don't exist as a buyable item from villagers, so we need to put an extra effort to mine down through the stones and gravels just to find out that you forgot to bring your Fortune III diamond pickaxe. We make mistakes, but the gist from all of this hard work is to work for other people so that you can get something else in return. From here, we can already see the flaw in the currency-based trading system: the effort spent and the time consumed. Bartering makes it more efficient in the trading system by taking the currency out of the equation. 3 diamonds is worth 15 potatos, and 2 diamonds is worth 8 blaze rods? This is the time to make use of your Algebra II knowledge. We can easily find out that 30 potatos is now worth 24 blaze rods. Or not. The bartering system not only makes the trade's worthiness becomes vague but also introduces so much inconsistencies in the trading system.

- Key to Success
Villagers are excellent examples of a successful trading scheme. First of all, they can be convinced to choose the profession that is of our interest. Although they have the trades, we get the power to decide which set of trade that a villager can provide for the rest of their life. Once the first trade is made, the villager will lock their trade and profession forever, which gives us an advantage to have a guaranteed resource in the future. Next, villagers of various professions collectively form an emerald-based trading ecosystem. The need of farming items still exist before trading with villagers, but the emerald system makes it faster and more convenient because trades become clear and consistent.

- Bottomline
So what can we learn from this? The art of trading is pretty subtle, especially in the world where villagers are in control of global trades. Some villagers are given more attention because their trades are more important than the other. One villager can be helpful to farm emeralds while the other can trade an item of our interest with our emeralds. Here, we can understand two main points of trading: interest and ecosystem. We have discussed how the villager's and our trading system are different, and the pros and cons of the currency-based versus bartering system. The flaws in our trading system can be further improved by learning from how villagers became our best interest and how their emerald-based trading ecosystem stayed alive to this day.
